# Stalfos

A skeletal collection of Sass helpers with a handy CSS utility class generator.

This project is no longer maintained and I was having issues getting it to work with pnpm, i.e. `"stalfos": "github:hankchizljaw/stalfos#c8971d22726326cfc04089b2da4d51eeb1ebb0eb"`. Thanks to Andy Bell for this project. https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/stalfos
